# Google OAuth Testing Checklist

## ‚úÖ **Current Status**
- [x] Google API scripts loaded
- [x] Authentication components created
- [x] OAuth service implemented
- [x] App updated to use authentication
- [ ] Google Cloud Console configured
- [ ] Client ID obtained and added
- [ ] Authorized users list updated
- [ ] System tested with school accounts

## üîß **Next Steps**

### **URGENT: Replace Client ID**

1. **Get your Client ID from Google Cloud Console**
2. **Open:** `src/services/authService.js`
3. **Replace line 6:**
   ```javascript
   this.clientId = 'PASTE_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE';
   ```
   With your actual Client ID:
   ```javascript
   this.clientId = '123456789-abcdefgh.apps.googleusercontent.com';
   ```

### **Add Authorized Staff Emails**

Edit `src/services/authService.js` lines 8-14 with real staff emails:
```javascript
this.authorizedUsers = new Set([
  'your.actual.email@cjc.edu.ph',
  'finance.officer@cjc.edu.ph',
  'admin@cjc.edu.ph',
  'staff.member@cjc.edu.ph'
  // Add all staff who can receive payments
]);
```

## üß™ **Testing Steps**

### **Test 1: Authentication Required**
1. Start your app: `npm start`
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. **Expected:** Should show login screen, NOT the payment form
4. **If payment form shows:** Authentication not working

### **Test 2: School Domain Restriction**
1. Try signing in with personal Gmail account
2. **Expected:** Should be rejected with domain error
3. **If allowed:** Domain restriction not working

### **Test 3: Authorization Check**
1. Sign in with school account NOT in authorized list
2. **Expected:** Should be rejected with "not authorized" error
3. **If allowed:** Authorization check not working

### **Test 4: Successful Authentication**
1. Sign in with school account that IS in authorized list
2. **Expected:** Should show payment form with your name auto-filled
3. **Check:** "Payment Received By" field shows your authenticated name

### **Test 5: Payment Recording**
1. Fill out a test payment
2. Submit the form
3. **Check:** Google Sheets shows your real name as receiver
4. **Check:** Email confirmation includes your authenticated info

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Error: "Google API not loaded"**
- Check if `https://apis.google.com/js/api.js` loads in browser console
- Ensure internet connection is working

### **Error: "Client ID not found"**
- Verify you replaced `PASTE_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE` with real Client ID
- Check Client ID format (should end with `.apps.googleusercontent.com`)

### **Error: "Origin not allowed"**
- Add `http://localhost:3000` to Authorized JavaScript origins in Google Cloud Console
- Make sure URL exactly matches (no trailing slash)

### **Error: "Access denied"**
- Check if your email is in the `authorizedUsers` set
- Verify email domain matches `schoolDomain` setting

## üìã **Google Cloud Console URLs**

Quick links for your setup:

1. **Project Dashboard:** https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard
2. **OAuth Consent:** https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent
3. **Credentials:** https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
4. **APIs & Services:** https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard

## ‚úÖ **Success Indicators**

When everything works correctly:
- ‚úÖ Only school staff can access the system
- ‚úÖ Staff name appears automatically as receiver
- ‚úÖ No way to fake or change receiver identity
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail in Google Sheets
- ‚úÖ Secure, enterprise-grade authentication

## üéØ **Final Test**

Try to break the system:
1. Can you access without signing in? ‚ùå Should be impossible
2. Can you sign in with personal email? ‚ùå Should be rejected
3. Can you change the receiver name? ‚ùå Should be locked
4. Can unauthorized staff access? ‚ùå Should be blocked

If all these are ‚ùå (impossible), your system is secure! üîê
